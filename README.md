# Voting_Management_Sysytem
The Voting Management System is a web-based application developed using PHP and MySQL to manage and streamline the voting process in an organized and secure manner. This project was created as part of my practical learning and development experience during my role as a Junior PHP Developer.

The system allows administrators and users to manage voters, candidates, and voting records efficiently. It includes features such as secure authentication, voter data management, vote casting, and result calculation. The project is designed to ensure data integrity, transparency, and ease of use.
This project was developed for educational and demonstration purposes, inspired by Mahanagarpalika elections, to handle a large volume of voter data based on a real-world voting workflow. It helped me gain hands-on experience in backend development, database management, and PHP-based web applications.
